A question from my programming assigment testing your knowledge on classes and the manipulation of objects and arrays.
This is a simple and non realistic library system.
The requirements of being able to borrow or return a book was not specified which is antithetical to the purpose of a library.


"A library wants to implement a management system for its book collection. You are requested to develop such a 
program in which you must:      
• Declare the base class Book to store basic book information with auto-generated IDs. 
• Use the function called getBookInfo() to input book details (title, author, publisher, ISBN). 
• Declare the derived class LibraryBook that inherits from Book. 
• Declare and define the function getStatus() to track book availability and borrowing history. 
• Define the function calculateFine() to determine overdue charges when books are returned late. 
• Create an array to store exactly 10 books. 
• Call the functions getBookInfo(), getStatus(), and calculateFine() for each book as needed. 
• Implement a menu-driven interface to manage all operations."
